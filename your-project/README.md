## Project Description
Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized political and social movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against black people. This project intends to analyze both causes for which the movement fights and better understand the nature of the racial situation in the US.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Is there a relation between race and gun violence?

Is there a relation between gun violence and inequality? 


## Dataset
I used the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports) and from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=kfdetail&iid=487#sources)

## Workflow
The workflow has been the following:
1. Find the data.
2. Clean data
3. Plot data
4. See patterns
5. Find more data on prisons to draw more meaningful insights
6. Presentation & final conclusions
