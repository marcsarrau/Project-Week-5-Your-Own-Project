## Project Description
Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized political and social movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against black people. This project intends to analyze both causes the movement fights for and better understand the nature of the racial situation in the US.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Is there a relation between race and gun violence?

Is there a relation between gun violence and inequality? 


## Dataset
